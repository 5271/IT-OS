# IT-OS
IT-OS is an operating system that aims to be simple, lightweight and flexible (because I can't do anything better). It is developed only by me and it's a hobby project that I'm doing to learn more about low-end stuff and how it all works so maybe I'll be able to help with linux development.

To build and run it you'll need `qemu`, `xorriso`, `gcc cross-compiler`, `binutils` and an usable Linux distribution.
